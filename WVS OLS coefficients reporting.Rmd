*A cross-national comparison, adjusted for educational attainment and relgious service attendance*

*Higher coefficients indicate a stronger relationship between right-wing economic ideology and higher levels of racial resentment (and between left-wing economic ideology and lower levels of racial resentment)*

<<<<<<< HEAD
*Method: Multiple linear regression*
